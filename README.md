### Task - PHP Code Refactoring: 

    TASK.md
    
### Author's Dev. Environment:

    os: OSX
    ide: PHPStorm 
    php_version: 7.2 
    debug: Xdebug
    unit_test: PHPUnit 8


### Instructions ( a moment )

Composer install for phpunit 8

    $ composer install

Run application 

    $ php app.php input.txt

Run PHPUnit test: ( able to run without internet )

    $ ./vendor/bin/phpunit 

### Things have done

    1. I have created a design for production
    2. This architecture will be re-usable
    3. Independent services
    4. Net and clean code
    5. used interface 
    6. kept raw php code in app.php 

### Recommendation 

    I enjoyed while working on this task. It's a nice test I believe. I am damn confident about this one. If we use redis in future this will be more robust application.

### Conclusion

    One of my best opportunity to participate with the test. I love to lear more. I think this will help me to grow my skill set in future. 
    Thanks for your time!
